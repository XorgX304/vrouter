DEBUGGING TOOLS:
Splint
Valgrind
GDB

Issues:
---------
**** Figure out if checksum shortcut will work****
**** Create all other checksums ****
**** Error checking with malloc (and memcpy?) ****
**** Have all functions return an int (for error checking) ****
**** Reverse back to network order when reconstructing packets ****
**** Figure out when to resend ARP requests for packets in queue ****	


Checksum Reference:
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1071.html


Notes:
When adding a new packet to the buffer or a new entry to the ARP cache, it should look similar
to the process used to add a new entry to the routing table in sr_load_rt() (sr_rt.c).
